# Backend

# Pre-reqs
To build and run this app locally you will need a few things:
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Getting started

- Install dependencies
```
cd ./backend
npm install
```
- Configure your mongoDB server
```bash
# create the db directory
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
# give the db correct read/write permissions
sudo chmod 777 /data/db

# starting from macOS 10.15 even the admin cannot create directory at root
# so lets create the db directory under the home directory.
mkdir -p ~/data/db
# user account has automatically read and write permissions for ~/data/db.
```
- Start your mongoDB server (you'll probably want another command prompt)
```bash
mongod

# on macOS 10.15 or above the db directory is under home directory
mongod --dbpath ~/data/db
```
- Build and run the project
```
npm run watch
```
Or, if you're using VS Code, you can use `cmd + shift + b` to run the default build task (which is mapped to `npm run build`), and then you can use the command palette (`cmd + shift + p`) and select `Tasks: Run Task` > `npm: start` to run `npm start` for you.

> **Note on editors!** - TypeScript has great support in [every editor](http://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links), but this project has been pre-configured for use with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Throughout the README We will try to call out specific places where VS Code really shines or where this project has been setup to take advantage of specific features.

Finally, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see the template being served and rendered locally!

# Deploying the app
There are many ways to deploy an Node app, and in general, nothing about the deployment process changes because you're using TypeScript.
In this section, I'll walk you through how to deploy this app to Azure App Service using the extensions available in VS Code because I think it is the easiest and fastest way to get started, as well as the most friendly workflow from a developer's perspective.

## Project Structure
The most obvious difference in a TypeScript + Node project is the folder structure.
In a TypeScript project, it's best to have separate _source_  and _distributable_ files.
TypeScript (`.ts`) files live in your `src` folder and after compilation are output as JavaScript (`.js`) in the `dist` folder.
The `test` and `views` folders remain top level as expected.

The full folder structure of this app is explained below:

> **Note!** Make sure you have already built the app using `npm run build`

### Running the build
All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
Npm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.
This is nice because most JavaScript tools have easy to use command line utilities allowing us to not need grunt or gulp to manage our builds.
If you open `package.json`, you will see a `scripts` section with all the different scripts you can call.
To call a script, simply run `npm run <script-name>` from the command line.
You'll notice that npm scripts can call each other which makes it easy to compose complex builds out of simple individual build scripts.
Below is a list of all the scripts this template has available:


| Npm Script | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`                   | Does the same as 'npm run serve'. Can be invoked with `npm start`                                 |
| `build`                   | Full build. Runs ALL build tasks (`build-sass`, `build-ts`, `lint`, `copy-static-assets`)       |
| `serve`                   | Runs node on `dist/server.js` which is the apps entry point                                       |
| `watch-node`              | Runs node with nodemon so the process restarts if it crashes. Used in the main watch task         |
| `watch`                   | Runs all watch tasks (TypeScript, Node). Use this if you're not touching static assets.     |
| `test`                    | Runs tests using Jest test runner                                                                 |
| `watch-test`              | Runs tests in watch mode                                                                          |
| `build-ts`                | Compiles all source `.ts` files to `.js` files in the `dist` folder                                 |
| `watch-ts`                | Same as `build-ts` but continuously watches `.ts` files and re-compiles when needed                |
| `lint`                    | Runs ESLint on project files                                                                       |
| `copy-static-assets`      | Calls script that copies JS libs, fonts, and images to dist directory                             |
| `debug`                   | Performs a full build and then serves the app in watch mode                                       |
| `serve-debug`             | Runs the app with the --inspect flag                                                               |
| `watch-debug`             | The same as `watch` but includes the --inspect flag so you can attach a debugger                   |

## Type Definition (`.d.ts`) Files
TypeScript uses `.d.ts` files to provide types for JavaScript libraries that were not written in TypeScript.
This is great because once you have a `.d.ts` file, TypeScript can type check that library and provide you better help in your editor.
The TypeScript community actively shares all of the most up-to-date `.d.ts` files for popular libraries on a GitHub repository called [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types).
Making sure that your `.d.ts` files are setup correctly is super important because once they're in place, you get an incredible amount of high quality type checking (and thus bug catching, IntelliSense, and other editor tools) for free.

> **Note!** Because we're using `"noImplicitAny": true`, we are required to have a `.d.ts` file for **every** library we use. While you could set `noImplicitAny` to `false` to silence errors about missing `.d.ts` files, it is a best practice to have a `.d.ts` file for every library. (Even if the `.d.ts` file is [basically empty!](#writing-a-dts-file))

### Installing `.d.ts` files from DefinitelyTyped
For the most part, you'll find `.d.ts` files for the libraries you are using on DefinitelyTyped.
These `.d.ts` files can be easily installed into your project by using the npm scope `@types`.
For example, if we want the `.d.ts` file for jQuery, we can do so with `npm install --save-dev @types/jquery`.
